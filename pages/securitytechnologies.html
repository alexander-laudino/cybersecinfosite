    <!-- Why are Firewalls and VPNs important? How do they help protect software, hardware, and data? How would you implement a Firewall - either from a from conceptual perspective or a technical one? -->
    <h1>Security Technologies</h1>
    <p>Firewalls act as the barrier between networks, such as between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network access via the Internet. A VPN allows for the creation of a private data network that utilized public networks to transmit data securely between a computer system outside of a network and a system inside a network. The firewall prevents malicious content from getting in and the VPN protects important information from getting out.</p>
    <p>The implementation that I utilize for my home network is the screened subnet with DMZ, but I have a few additional features added on for redundancy and security. I use the open-source router software pfSense to manage my internal networks, it is installed on a stand-alone machine that is set up as a Multi-WAN Load Balancer with Failover. This allows two external gateway networks to be combined into one connection that I connect through. The external connections are on separate backbone networks, one being fiber and the other being cable, to ensure that if one were to go down, my network would remain connected. I leverage pfSense’s internal firewall rules to balance the requests going out as the networks run at different speeds, fiber at 1Gb/s and cable at 30Mb/s, as to prevent bottlenecking on the slower network. There are two DMZ’s that exist, each lying between the pfSense firewall and each of the gateway’s firewalls. In a prior iteration, I created a third DMZ that sat between the pfSense firewall and another router, but I haven’t gotten the opportunity to do a SDLC on it before added it to my security architecture.</p>

    <p>In addition, I utilize pgBlocker-NG, which introduces an Enhanced Alias Table Feature that allows for blocking country and IP ranges as well as the usage of open-source lists that include additional IPs to block.</p>

    <p>Rather than hard-coding my VPN into the firewall, I run applications locally on each of my devices that controls its respective network connection. The software is configured with a Kill Switch that prevents IP leakage if I lose connection to the VPN network by disconnecting the local connection and preventing traffic from being sent or received. With this in place, I establish a secure perimeter around my network that ensures the untrusted stays out and the trusted remains secured.</p>
