    <!-- Why is coding vital for security? Provide instances where HIPPA, National Security, Bank/Heath industries must have stringent coding practices. Explain why. If possible, provide a small piece of code (Java or Python snippet) that illustrates this. -->
    <h1>The Need for Security</h1>
    <p>Because at this point, software has eaten the world, and everything comes down to the code. For HIPPA, applications that are used in the medical field must ensure that they are meeting strict privacy standards as they are dealing with individuals’ private medical information and so that data must be kept secure. The NSA deals with national secrets and in turn high-level cryptography that ensures the data stays secure and inaccessible if it were to fall into enemy hands. With banks, they handle all our financial lives and to keep the market running efficiently, they cannot have errors, or we see something like the Flash Crash that occurred in 2010. With Banks and the Health industry, they must be more concerned about Injection risks as the data that they handle has the power to alter an individual’s life.</p>
    <p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) maintains a list of the Top 10 risks associated with developing secure web applications and if we look to it, we can see that coding comes into play in just about all of them. If we look at the list, we can see that the top three for 2021 are all associated with coding: Broken Access Control, Cryptographic Failures, and Injection. Prior to 2021, injection had been at the top of the list, it deals with the vulnerability that comes when a SQL query or command is injected into the input fields of an application which allows the attacker to get access to sensitive data. One method used to avoid this is the use of prepared statements. A prepared statement is the usage of a parameterized interface to control the commands that are sent to the database. Below is an example of a prepared statement in Java.</p>
