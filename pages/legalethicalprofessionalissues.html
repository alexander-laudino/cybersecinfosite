    <h1>Legal, Ethical, and Professional Issues in Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p>There are several gaps in existing legislature in this country that are in need to update as the economic impact of cybercrime continues to rise. I got my introduction to cybersecurity and all the various components involved while working in various roles supporting restaurant point-of-sale systems. This gave me the opportunity to become acclimated with PCI DSS. I was working at the company when they released the latest version, moving from swipe-and-sign to chip-and-pin credit cards, something the rest of the world had already adopted years earlier. With this change also came a shift in liability when fraudulent transactions occurred, from the banks being responsible for covering the losses to the merchants now having to pay. This shift was welcome as I saw the massive security holes that existed in the networks I supported and I was powerless to do anything as our company didn’t manage the networks, only the POS and credit card systems. It was then that I started to realize the total lack of care for cybersecurity that existed not only in that industry but across every industry. Security best practices were often overlooked for necessity and ease-of-use with no recourse available as the PCI Security Standards Council does not require compliance to be mandatory for all entities and so it has no “teeth”.</p>
    <p>From that point forward, I began my journey into understanding cybersecurity’s role in not just my own but all our lives. I left that company at the end of 2014 and was introduced to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency shortly thereafter in January of 2015. I initially spent several months doing research so that I could understand how the software worked and how it was secured via a cryptographic hash function known as SHA256. After a few unsuccessful projects, I began to work with a company that provided financial services in the form of cost saving and tax mitigation services. In this role, we were required to collect certain financial documents from a company’s owner and then pass them along to our backend for processing. Boy was that an eye-opener, seeing how insecure everyone treated PII client information was a wake up for me as to how little these things matter to most people. This leads into the issues that we are currently facing in the US as we begin to address data privacy laws.</p>
    <p>I had already begun to remove myself from social media at that point after I realized what was going on with my data behind the scenes, a complete profile on my life was being created so I could be advertised to. It was around this time that GDPR began to be discussed in the EU and I saw it as a step in the right direction as at least some governments were mature enough to address the issues. As I got deeper into the cryptosphere, I began to see the total lack of security and issues that surrounded the use of cryptocurrency. After moving back from California, I began to work with a VC firm in NYC and was able to put a little into the market, some for speculation but more to use the technology and get hands-on experience with the ecosystems. Around that time California also began to address data privacy and I saw that some in the US had begun to see the need for improved laws. This leads us to today and the issue we have been seeing playing out over the past several years are finally coming to a head with US tech companies and the EU over data privacy rights.</p>
    <p>The problem that we are seeing is that the EU does not want their citizen’s data to be transferred to the US for processing. This can be directly linked to the fact that the US has lax data privacy laws and so the EU knows their citizen’s data won’t be protected under the current US system. The issue behind this is the lack of global data transfer laws as the end result of the GDPR would mean companies in the EU would not be able to use US company’s services as the data is legal not allowed to be transferred to US servers.</p>
    <p>How do we modify this system? We take a note from the EU and implement better data privacy laws on a federal level in the US. We implement laws to ensure companies are providing end users with an easy-to-understand privacy policy and easier ways to opt out of certain tracking features. This will lead to software development that looks at the ways they use data, as instead of sucking it up like a vacuum, they will only be provided with the data that is required for that service to function. This will lead to better overall security as there are less vectors that could attacked.</p>
