    <h1>Physical Security, Implementation of Information Security Program, and Maintenance of Information Security Program</h1>
    <p>Physical security encompasses all the controls and measures required to secure the physical resources of an organization. These controls are as, if not more, important than the information security controls as if an attacker gains physical access to the hardware, the logical controls are much less effective. Facilities management is responsible for securing the facility while general management is responsible for the management of keys and locks. Design and planning is important here as different locking mechanisms can be put in place depending on the resource inside, if safety is paramount, then fail-safe locks will be installed, if security is paramount, then fail-secure locks will be installed.</p>
    <p>Fire detection systems are important for detecting and responding to fire, as well as determining the proper fire suppression system to be installed as some are better for electrical fires as water will only increase the damage. The HVAC system is important for preventing damage from static electricity due to temperature, humidity, or dust build up. Finally, data can be intercepted in either electronic or manual format via direct observation, interception of data transmission, and interception of electromagnetic radiation. The process of implementing proper physical security controls is just as daunting as implementing the controls on the information security side.</p>
    <p>Implementing information security properly requires the translation of blueprints into a concrete project plan that is spearheaded by a project manager or product champion. Before developing the plan, management should involve all necessary stakeholders to ensure coordination of the organization’s resources, supervision of the project, and verification of project completion. There are many tools that can be used but a simple work breakdown structure can be created to address all major tasks and their related subtasks and actions. Change and configuration management is vital before, during, and after this process and should be implemented systematically throughout the organization to handle future implementations. The system can be converted using four common strategies: direct changeover, phased implementation, pilot implementation, and parallel operations. All of this is put in place so that the external certification and accreditation process can be done for the system and proper authorization is issued by management for use of the system.</p>
    <p>Security and personnel can be one of the most difficult areas as the question of where to place the information security function within the organization becomes an important decision. A balance is required to allow for the security team to operate and enforce company policy within the bounds of the organization without affecting operations. Selecting individuals to work in information security requires a vast set of skills, experience, and knowledgebase as a solid understanding of business and technology is required. There are many certifications available that help to identify qualified candidates and it is important that general management incorporate information security concepts into all areas of the business as to ensure its importance with all personnel. A key concept here is the separation of duties in controls as to reduce the chance of any one individual having too much power or access to sensitive information or systems.</p>
    <p>Information security maintenance revolves around the inevitability of change that is present within organizations and the world. The CISO is in charge of deciding whether the information security program will need to be changed or adapted to the current environment. This requires an update of all policies and procedures along with a review of all systems, personnel, and data to ensure the program is addressing every evolving vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks. The maintenance program covers five domains: external monitoring, internal monitoring, planning and risk assessment, vulnerability assessment and remediation, and readiness and review.</p>
    <p>External monitoring provides early awareness of new and emerging threats and vulnerabilities so that an effective and timely defensive response can be implemented. Internal monitoring informs awareness of the state of the organization’s networks, information systems, and information security defenses with a focus on documentation. Planning and risk assessment ensures the entire security program is watched over. Vulnerability assessment and remediation involves the identification of specific, documented vulnerabilities and the process to remediate them in a timely manner.</p>
