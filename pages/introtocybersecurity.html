    <h1>Introduction to Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p>As computer systems advanced and access to them was no longer dependent on a physical location, the need to secure the system and all connected systems arose. Information security and the field of cyber security grew out of that need, and as ever more devices, networks, and individuals become connected and reliant on this shared network, the need for more advanced techniques is required. </p>
    <p>Today, as everything becomes connected, the attack surface has increased almost infinitely, but the US DHS has identified 16 sectors that are critical to our infrastructure and has specific cybersecurity programs set up to help identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities and distribute the information to key organizations involved. The problem is, and I think we started to see signs of this over the past two years, is that all the sectors are co-dependent on the others and so one sector cannot be affected without it effecting the others. When you think about it, it is a fragile system, and we always assume that it will function properly, until it doesn’t. A lot of us are also naïve in thinking that there aren’t malicious actors out there actively trying to manipulate and take down our systems, which there are. We can see how critical it is that these systems are not only operational but secured, and that is why there is a need for cyber security professionals.</p>
    <p>We have already seen what one type of virus can do to the global economy, but I doubt most people can imagine the impact that another type of virus might have. Cyber security professionals know the impact that a breach could have on a system, and they will play a crucial role as we move forward.</p>
