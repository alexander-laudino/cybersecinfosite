    <!-- Describe a fake login management scenario. Identify several authentication practices. Are passwords becoming obsolete? -->
    <h1>Password Authentication</h1>
    <p>A fake login management scenario is a type of a man-in-the-middle attack. The attacker sets up a fake login page for a known company and then baits their target into filling in their credentials using a link that is shared. The form in which the user is targeted can be passive as in sending an email, or can be active as when an individual calls their target on the phone and uses social engineering to get their target to the page. At the same time, the attacker will have the real website open and once their target tries to log in to the fake page, the credentials will be used to access the target’s account, in the absence of a second factor for authentication, the attacker will then have full control over the now victim’s account.</p>
    <p>Authentication practices can be broken down into three categories of factors; something a person knows (authentication by knowledge), something a person has (authentication by ownership), and something a person is (authentication by characteristic).</p>
    <ul id="authenticationFactors">
        <li>Something a person <strong><em>knows</em></strong>
            <ul id="authByKnowledge">
                <li>Password</li>
                <li>Pin</li>
                <li>Cognitive passwords (fact- and opinion-based information)</li>
                <li>Personal history information</li>
                <li>Passphrases</li>
                <li>Combination to a lock</li>
                <li>CAPTCHA</li>
                <li>Spatial location</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Something a person <strong><em>has</em></strong>
            <ul id="authByOwnership">
                <li>Key</li>
                <li>Swipe card</li>
                <li>Access card</li>
                <li>Badge</li>
                <li>Memory card</li>
                <li>Smart card</li>
                <li>OTP generator / Token device</li>
                <li>Private key</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Something a person <strong><em>is</em></strong>
            <ul id="authByCharacteristic">
                <li>Biometrics
                    <ul id="biometrics">
                        <li>Fingerprint</li>
                        <li>Palm scan</li>
                        <li>Hand geometry</li>
                        <li>Retina scan</li>
                        <li>Iris scan</li>
                        <li>Signature dynamics</li>
                        <li>Keystroke dynamics</li>
                        <li>Voice print</li>
                        <li>Facial scan</li>
                        <li>Hand topography</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <p>A fourth kind of factor exists that I think is worth mentioning as a combination of two others</p>
        <li>Something a person <strong><em>knows</em></strong> and <strong><em>has</em></strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Key file</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>When authentication factors are used in a combination of two or more, it is known as strong authentication or multi-factor authentication, and it provides additional layers of security for identity and access management.</p>
    <p>I do not believe that passwords will become obsolete as they are a crucial piece that is needed in the authentication equation. I do believe passwords as a sole means of accessing accounts should be done away with as anything less than 2 factors being used for authentication is a recipe for trouble. I had set up a system where I only needed to remember two passwords and 4 key files, the first password in combination with three key files are used to decrypt my data and the second password is used in combination with a key file to decrypt my password manager database. The password manager is then used in combination with other factors to unlock each account. Without passwords, my entire cybersecurity system becomes weaker as the factors I used for ownership-authentication can be lost or stolen and is liable to get lost, and something a person is doesn’t always remain the same, like when a person’s voice can be different when they are sick. Individually, the factors all have their weaknesses, which is why it is important to use 2FA and MFA when setting up security for online accounts.</p>
